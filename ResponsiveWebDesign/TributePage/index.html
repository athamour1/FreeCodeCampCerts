            <h2>History</h2>
            <h3>Precursors</h3>
            <p>The Unix operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969, at AT&T's Bell Labs, in
                the United States by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna.
                First released in 1971, Unix was written entirely in assembly language, as was common
                practice at the time. In 1973 in a key, pioneering approach, it was rewritten in the C
                programming language by Dennis Ritchie (with the exception of some hardware and I/O
                routines). The availability of a high-level language implementation of Unix made its
                porting to different computer platforms easier.</p>
            <p>Due to an earlier antitrust case forbidding it from entering the computer business, AT&T
                was required to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked. As a
                result, Unix grew quickly and became widely adopted by academic institutions and
                businesses. In 1984, AT&T divested itself of Bell Labs; freed of the legal obligation
                requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a proprietary product, where
                users were not legally allowed to modify Unix.</p>
            <p>The GNU Project, started in 1983 by Richard Stallman, had the goal of creating a
                "complete Unix-compatible software system" composed entirely of free software. Work
                began in 1984. Later, in 1985, Stallman started the Free Software Foundation and
                wrote the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the
                programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, compilers, text editors, a
                command-line shell, and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements
                such as device drivers, daemons, and the kernel, called GNU Hurd, were stalled and
                incomplete.</p>
            <p>
                MINIX was created by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, a computer science professor, and released in
                1987 as a minimal Unix-like operating system targeted at students and others who wanted
                to learn operating system principles. Although the complete source code of MINIX was
                freely available, the licensing terms prevented it from being free software until the
                licensing changed in April 2000.</p>
            <p>Although not released until 1992, due to legal complications, development of 386BSD, from
                which NetBSD, OpenBSD and FreeBSD descended, predated that of Linux.</p>
            <p>Linus Torvalds has stated on separate occasions that if the GNU kernel or 386BSD had been
                available at the time (1991), he probably would not have created Linux.</p>
            <h3>Creation</h3>
            <p>In 1991, while attending the University of Helsinki, Torvalds became curious about
                operating systems. Frustrated by the licensing of MINIX, which at the time limited
                it to educational use only, he began to work on his own operating system kernel,
                which eventually became the Linux kernel.</p>
            <p>
                Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX and applications written for
                MINIX were also used on Linux. Later, Linux matured and further Linux kernel development
                took place on Linux systems. GNU applications also replaced all MINIX components,
                because it was advantageous to use the freely available code from the GNU Project with
                the fledgling operating system; code licensed under the GNU GPL can be reused in other
                computer programs as long as they also are released under the same or a compatible
                license. Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license, which prohibited
                commercial redistribution, to the GNU GPL. Developers worked to integrate GNU
                components with the Linux kernel, making a fully functional and free operating
                system.
            </p>
            <h3>Naming</h3>
            <p>Linus Torvalds had wanted to call his invention "Freax", a portmanteau of "free",
                "freak", and "x" (as an allusion to Unix). During the start of his work on the system,
                some of the project's makefiles included the name "Freax" for about half a year.
                Torvalds had already considered the name "Linux", but initially dismissed it as too
                egotistical.</p>
            <p>
                To facilitate development, the files were uploaded to the FTP server (ftp.funet.fi) of
                FUNET in September 1991. Ari Lemmke, Torvalds' coworker at the Helsinki University of
                Technology (HUT), who was one of the volunteer administrators for the FTP server at the
                time, did not think that "Freax" was a good name, so he named the project "Linux" on the
                server without consulting Torvalds. Later, however, Torvalds consented to "Linux".
            </p>
            <p>
                According to a newsgroup post by Torvalds, the word "Linux" should be pronounced
                with a short 'i' as in 'print' and 'u' as
                in 'put'. To further demonstrate how the word "Linux" should be pronounced, he included
                an audio guide with the kernel source code.
                However, in this recording, he pronounces 'Linux' LEEN-uuks with a short but close
                unrounded front vowel.
            </p>
            <h3>Commercial and popular uptake</h3>
            <p>
                Adoption of Linux in production environments, rather than being used only by hobbyists,
                started to take off first in the mid-1990s in the supercomputing community, where
                organizations such as NASA started to replace their increasingly expensive machines with
                clusters of inexpensive commodity computers running Linux. Commercial use began when
                Dell and IBM, followed by Hewlett-Packard, started offering Linux support to escape
                Microsoft's monopoly in the desktop operating system market.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Linux systems are used throughout computing, from embedded systems to virtually
                all supercomputers, and have secured a place in server installations such as the
                popular LAMP application stack. Use of Linux distributions in home and enterprise
                desktops has been growing. Linux distributions have also
                become popular in the netbook market, with many devices shipping with customized Linux
                distributions installed, and Google releasing their own Chrome OS designed for netbooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Linux's greatest success in the consumer market is perhaps the mobile device market,
                with Android being the dominant operating system on smartphones and very popular on
                tablets and, more recently, on wearables. Linux gaming is also on the rise with Valve
                showing its support for Linux and rolling out SteamOS, its own gaming-oriented Linux
                distribution. Linux distributions have also gained popularity with various local and
                national governments, such as the federal government of Brazil.
            </p>
            <h3>Current development</h3>
            <p>Greg Kroah-Hartman is the lead maintainer for the Linux kernel and guides its
                development. William John Sullivan is the executive director of the Free Software
                Foundation, which in turn supports the GNU components. Finally, individuals and
                corporations develop third-party non-GNU components. These third-party components
                comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications
                and libraries.</p>
            <p>
                Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU components, and
                non-GNU components, with additional package management software in the form of Linux
                distributions.
